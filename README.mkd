## Introduction
`mbox` is a Go library to parse mbox files. It currently supports the mboxrd
format used for example for Google Mail exports.

## Library
The basic use case is to open a mailbox file and read its messages. The
following code does not include error handling.

```go
mbox, _ := mbox.Open(path, format)

for {
    mboxMsg, _ := mbox.Read()
    if mboxMsg == nil {
        break
    }

    fmt.Printf("%s\n", mboxMsg.Id)
}

mbox.Close()
```

## mbox command
The `mbox` directory contains a tool to work with mbox files. Commands and
options can be displayed with `mbox -h`.
